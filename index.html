      <h3>What is <img src="images/logo.png">?</h3>
    </b>
    <p>Undertale is a 2015 role-playing video game created by American indie developer Toby Fox. The player controls
      a child who has fallen into the Underground: a large, secluded region under the surface of the Earth, separated by
      a magical barrier.
      The player meets various monsters during the journey back to the surface, some of which may engage in combat. The
      combat system involves
      the player navigating through mini-bullet hell attacks by the opponent. They can opt to appease monsters in order
      to spare them
      instead of killing them. These choices affect the game, with the dialogue, characters, and story changing based on
      outcomes.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="japa_wiktor">
    <h3><b>What is This type of games even about?</b></h3>
    <p>Undertale and Deltarune are a role-playing video games that use a top-down perspective.
      In the game, the player controls a child and completes objectives in order to progress through the story.
      Players explore a world, and are required to solve numerous puzzles on their journey.
      The world is the home of monsters, many of whom challenge the player in combat;
      players decide whether to kill, flee from, or befriend them.
      Choices made by the player radically affect the plot and general progression of the game, with the player's
      morality acting as the cornerstone for the game's development.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="japa_wiktor">
    <h3><b>Something About Development...</b></h3>
    <p>Undertale was developed by Toby Fox across 32 months.
      Development was financed through a crowdfunding campaign on the website Kickstarter
      The campaign was launched on June 25, 2013, with a goal of US$5,000; it ended on July 25, 2013, with US$51,124
      raised by 2,398 people.
      Fox had little experience with game development;
      he and his three brothers often used RPG Maker 2000 to make role-playing games, though few were ever completed.
      Fox also worked on several EarthBound ROM hacks while in high school.
      Before the release of Undertale, he was best known for composing music for the webcomic Homestuck, starting in
      2010.
      Undertale was the first full game that he wrote.</p>

    <p>According to Fox, he was casually reading Wikipedia in December 2012 when he found its article for array data
      structures,
      something Fox did not have knowledge of.
      After reading the page, he thought about how he could use it to create a text system for an RPG.
      After completing it, he came up with the idea of creating a battle system.
      This system, which was created using the game creation system
      GameMaker: Studio, informed how Fox wrote the story, as both are intertwined.
      He wanted to develop a role-playing game that was different from the traditional design, which he often found
      "boring to play".
      He set out to develop a game with "interesting characters", and that "utilizes the medium as a storytelling device
      ...
      instead of having the story and gameplay abstractions be completely separate".</p>
