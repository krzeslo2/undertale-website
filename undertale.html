                        <p>Undertale is set in the Underground, a realm where monsters were banished after war broke out
                            with humans
                            before the events of the game. The Underground is sealed from the surface by a magic barrier
                            with a
                            singular gap at Mount Ebott. At the start of the game a player-named human child falls into
                            the
                            Underground from Mount Ebott and encounters Flowey, a sentient flower who teaches the player
                            the game's
                            mechanics and lies about "LV", or "LOVE", in an attempt to kill them. The human is then
                            rescued by
                            Toriel, a motherly goat-like monster, who teaches them how to survive conflict in the
                            Underground
                            without killing. She intends to adopt the human, wanting to protect them from Asgore, the
                            king of the
                            Underground.
                            <br><br>
                            The human eventually leaves Toriel to search for Asgore's castle, which contains the barrier
                            to the
                            surface world. They encounter several monsters, such as the skeletons Sans and Papyrus, two
                            brothers who
                            act as sentries for the Snowdin forest; Undyne, the head of the royal guard; Alphys, the
                            kingdom's royal
                            scientist; and Mettaton, a robotic television host Alphys created. Most of the monsters are
                            fought, with
                            the human choosing whether to kill them or to spare and possibly befriend the monster.
                            During their
                            travels, the human learns that many years ago, Asriel, the son of Asgore and Toriel,
                            befriended the
                            first human who fell into the Underground. When the child abruptly died, Asriel used the
                            child's soul to
                            pass through the barrier, intending to return the body to the surface. The humans living
                            there attacked
                            and killed Asriel, causing Asgore to declare war. In the present day, Asgore has collected
                            six souls
                            from fallen humans, and needs one more to destroy the barrier.
                            <br><br>
                            The game's ending depends on how the player handles encounters with monsters. If the player
                            killed some but not all monsters, or did not kill any, they experience the "Neutral" ending.
                            The human
                            arrives at Asgore's castle and is forced to fight him. Sans stops the human before their
                            confrontation,
                            revealing that the human's "LOVE" and "EXP" are acronyms for "level of violence" and
                            "execution points",
                            respectively. Sans judges the human based on their accumulated "LOVE" and "EXP". The human
                            then
                            fights Asgore, but Flowey interrupts, killing Asgore, and transforming into a more powerful
                            form by
                            stealing the human souls. With the aid of the rebelling souls, the human defeats Flowey and
                            can choose
                            to either kill or spare him. The human then leaves the underground. They later receive a
                            phone call from
                            Sans, explaining the state of the Underground after the human's departure.

                            If the player kills no monsters before completing a "neutral" ending, they can reload their
                            saved game
                            to complete the "true pacifist" ending.Flowey is revealed to be a reincarnation of Asriel
                            accidentally created by Alphys's experiments. During the fight with Asgore, Toriel stops the
                            battle and
                            is joined by the other monsters the human befriended. Flowey ambushes the group, absorbing
                            the souls of
                            all the humans and monsters in order to take an older Asriel's form. During the ensuing
                            fight, the human
                            manages to connect with the souls of their friends, and eventually defeats Asriel: He
                            reverts to his
                            child form, destroys the barrier, and expresses remorse for his actions before leaving,
                            revealing the
                            human's true name as Frisk. The human falls unconscious and is awoken to see their friends
                            surrounding
                            them. The monsters peacefully reintegrate with the humans, while the human has the option of
                            accepting
                            Toriel as their adoptive mother.

                            A third ending, known by fans as the "No Mercy" or "Genocide" ending, ensues if the player
                            kills every
                            single fightable monster. They must repeatedly trigger random encounters in each area until
                            no more
                            monsters remain. This route changes aspects of the game: many characters evacuate to escape
                            the player,
                            and those that remain have modified dialogue reflecting the impact their actions are having
                            on the
                            game's world. When the human reaches Asgore's castle, Sans attempts to stop them, but fails
                            and
                            is slain. Flowey kills Asgore in an attempt to obtain mercy, but is killed by the human.
                            Chara, the
                            first fallen child who befriended Asriel, then appears and erases the world. To enable
                            further replays
                            of the game, the player must give their soul to Chara, restoring the world and causing a
                            permanent
                            alteration to the true pacifist ending.
