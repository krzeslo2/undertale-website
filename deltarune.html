      <p class="opis">
        The game begins with a voice prompting the player to create an avatar, but the "vessel" is
        ultimately discarded, as "no one can choose who they are in this world". Instead, the player is given control of
        human teenager Kris, who arrives to school late. After being paired up with their delinquent monster classmate
        Susie for a group project, their teacher, Alphys, sends the two to get supplies. However, the supply closet
        shuts behind them and they fall into a strange realm—the Dark World—where they meet the dark prince Ralsei. He
        tells them of a prophecy stating that the three of them are heroes destined to close the geyser-like Dark
        Fountains that give form to the Dark Worlds. A new Dark Fountain has created a Dark World next to Ralsei's,
        ruled by the tyrannical King. Susie, uninterested in Ralsei's prophecy, joins King's son Lancer in fighting Kris
        and Ralsei, but both are convinced to change sides and join the party.

        Lancer refuses to confront his father or to see his new friends hurt, so he imprisons them in King's dungeon.
        Susie frees Kris and Ralsei and fights Lancer, but reconciles with him and promises not to hurt King. The three
        confront and defeat King, who remains unrepentant. After sealing the Dark Fountain, Kris and Susie wake in an
        unused classroom. The room is filled with objects resembling characters, suggesting that Dark Worlds are
        reflections of ordinary rooms, and their inhabitants, known as Darkners, are simply objects within those rooms.
        That night, after returning home, Kris rips out their soul (which remains controlled by the player), locks it
        away, and draws a knife.

      <p class="opis">
        After school the following day, Kris and Susie return to the closet Dark World and reunite with
        Ralsei. He instructs them to bring the items from the unused classroom into the closet, restoring them to their
        Darkner forms. He then tells them to focus on their school project with classmates Noelle Holiday and Berdly.
        Arriving at the library's computer lab, they discover a newly created Dark World ruled by a computer named
        Queen. Queen recruits Berdly to her side and attempts to recruit Noelle. The group finds Ralsei, but they soon
        split up. Kris joins Noelle in helping her evade Queen's attempts to recruit her.

        Queen captures everyone, but Kris and Susie escape and convince Berdly to switch sides before later reuniting
        with Ralsei. Queen reveals that the Dark Fountain was created by an entity known as the Roaring Knight, and that
        she intends to force Noelle to open a Fountain, which any inhabitant of the Light World can do. She threatens
        Noelle and the party with a giant mech, but they manage to make her realize the error of her ways. Berdly then
        attempts to create a Fountain, but Ralsei warns him that opening too many Fountains will cause an apocalyptic
        "Roaring".

        Kris closes the Fountain, and the four awaken in the computer lab; Noelle and Berdly dismiss the events as
        merely a dream. Kris heads home, and their mother, Toriel, invites Susie to spend the night. While Susie and
        Toriel are occupied, Kris secretly rips out their soul, locks it in the bathroom, and briefly leaves the house
        off-screen. Toriel finds her car tires slashed, prompting her to call the police. After everyone else falls
        asleep, Kris rips out their soul once more and creates a Dark Fountain in the living room by stabbing the floor
        with their knife.

      <p class="opis">
        Kris and Susie awaken in the Dark World Kris created. After reuniting with Ralsei, they meet
        Tenna—a Darkner created from Toriel's television—who convinces the trio to star in various game show segments.
        Sneaking away from Tenna, the party discovers Toriel being held hostage by Tenna inside of a giant toy capsule.

        The party demands Tenna stop the games, allowing them to seal the fountain and return home with Toriel, but he
        refuses; feeling abandoned and obsolete, he explains that the Roaring Knight promised him relevance in exchange
        for keeping the Fountain open. After the party defeats Tenna, Ralsei and Susie comfort him, explaining that he
        has already spent years bringing joy and can find love and appreciation in another household.

        However, he is suddenly attacked by the Knight, who also attempts to capture Toriel. The party then fights the
        Knight and is ultimately defeated, only to be rescued by the arrival of police officer Undyne, who the Knight
        kidnaps. Kris and Susie chase the Knight through the Light World until reaching a locked bunker which appears to
        have a Dark Fountain inside of it. The door shuts before they can enter, but they discover a lock requiring
        three numeric codes. Susie runs back to Kris's home to rescue Toriel. The chapter ends with the bunker door
        opening in front of Kris.

      <p class="opis">
        After Kris and Susie close the living room Dark Fountain, Toriel wakes them and they go to church.
        Questioning townsfolk about the bunker, the two conclude that their best lead on the codes is Noelle's mother,
        Mayor Carol Holiday. They visit the Holidays' house, where Susie distracts Noelle while Kris searches. In the
        bedroom of Noelle's missing sister Dess, Kris finds a code in a guitar, but Kris rips out their soul before it
        can be fully read. The player-controlled soul enters the house's ventilation, finding Kris on the phone with an
        unknown person who discusses the Knight's actions and instructs them to prevent Susie from getting the guitar.
        Kris fails to prevent Susie finding the guitar and returns the soul to their body, but Carol returns home and
        expels Susie from the house before she can memorize the code.

        Upon returning to the church, Kris and Susie find it transformed into a Dark World containing depictions of the
        prophecy. In the Dark World, they reunite with Ralsei and encounter an old man formed from the ashes of dead
        Light World inhabitant Gerson Boom. Ralsei admits that he has been hiding parts of the prophecy from Kris and
        Susie because he believes the truth would be too upsetting.

        The party encounters the Knight, who opens a Fountain within the Dark World, creating a "Titan", a harbinger of
        the Roaring. The party defeats the Titan with help from Gerson. Against Ralsei's protests, Susie runs ahead and
        sees the ending of the prophecy. She smashes it before the player sees, dismissing it as something the party
        would never let happen. After sealing the Fountain, they return home to find Toriel drunk with the grocery store
        janitor, Sans. Susie leaves and Kris, alone in their bedroom, is reminded by the unknown caller on their phone
        of a promise Kris made.
